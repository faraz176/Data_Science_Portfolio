## Contents

* ### Machine Learning
  * [India Analysis](https://github.com/faraz176/India_Dataset/blob/master/India_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb). A complete analysis over a Covid-19 Dataset from India.
    this analysis includes Data Extraction, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling with Multiple Linear Regression. At the end it contains the conclusions
    I found from the dataset and articles that validated my analysis.
    
  * [Email Spam Detection](https://github.com/faraz176/Email_Spam_Classifier). Built an email classifier which classifies emails as spam or not spam using Logistic Regression and uses metrics such as Cross-Validation, ROC, AOC, and Hyper Parameters Tuning to find the best model along with transforming basic text into input for the classifier.
  
  
* ### Software Engineering
  * [Web Automation with Selenium](https://github.com/faraz176/TikTok-BruteFroce). Using selenium I created a web automation tool which tests out the login feature of pages.
  * [Connect 4 AI with MiniMax](https://github.com/faraz176/Connect_4_Ai). I created a connect 4 game from scratch and created an over powered AI using a Minimax algorithm (still in progress).
  
  * [Company Email Address Generator](https://github.com/faraz176/Company_Email/blob/main/normdistributed.py). I created a class that takes in the companies websites as input and the employees name. It then outputs an email for that employee. Ex: John.M.Smith@crosscorp.com
  
* ### Statistics
  * [Simulating Binomial Distribution with Python](https://github.com/faraz176/Binomial-Distribution/blob/main/Binomial%20Distribution.ipynb). I solved Binomial Distribution problems using python. 
  
* ### Micro Projects
  * [Class of Useful Pandas Functions](https://github.com/faraz176/useful_pandas_functions/blob/master/classes.py) A class of useful pandas functions I have created to help me with unique computations.
